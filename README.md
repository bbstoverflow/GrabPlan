# GrabPlan
__**Summary**__

GrabPay will be a new component on the Grab app which provides pre-planned outings (plans) by users for users.

_"Plan": 
Under GrabPlan, a “plan” is a structured itinerary (maximum length of 1 day) which provides users with places of interest to visit. Such places include food locations (hawker centres, restaurants, coffee shops, etc), entertainment facilities (karaoke, cinemas, bowling, etc) and any other place deemed noteworthy by users.
Users are able to craft and submit plans to GrabPlan where other users will browse and select plans to explore. Plans can be reviewed and rated by users, allowing for ranking of plans in terms of quality.
Plans can be split into different categories, such as based on theme (food, hiking, mix, etc) and based on target groups (friends, co-workers, couples, etc)
As an incentive, users could possibly be rewarded (Grab credits etc) for submitting plans that become very highly-rated._

A catalogue of plans will be available for users to browse and select. Each plan will have a rating based on feedback from other users as well as reviews from users who have tried the plan.

When a user selects and confirms a plan, GrabPlan can immediately and automatically carry out the booking/purchasing of tickets for all the relevant venues through GrabPay. Additionally, GrabPlan can simultaneously book a GrabCar driver to fetch the user to their location.

**Benefits to Grab**

Vendors who wish to be featured on plans thus will be encouraged to provide GrabPay services to attract more customers. With plans that encompass a wide variety of categories of interesting places, more places will integrate GrabPay and thus GrabPay will be more universally used.

Increased use of GrabCar to fetch users to their plans’ starting location.



**Challenges - How do we fulfil them?**
1. AWS

  Use AWS Amplify to build a mobile or web application that connects to at least one AWS service. (TODO: specify subservice)
With the enormous computational power and space needed for the GrabPlan component (geolocation purposes, payment, large user base and review system for plans, machine learning for predictive recommending of plans to users), AWS Amplify will be used to scale up. AWS APIs will be used as well to facilitate development.

2. Grab

  Improve financial inclusion across the region.
One aspect of better financial inclusion is having a universal/ubiquitous payment service. This is too encourage more vendors to implement the GrabPay services. Since GrabPlan has the potential to include much more than just food vendors (places of interest, attractions, etc) through its user-submitted plans, more vendors can be attracted to using GrabPay services in order to be featured on GrabPlan. This would help improve financial inclusion across the region by migrating more transactions over to GrabPay. This would help advance towards a cashless society while cementing Grab as the super app in Singapore (much like WeChat in China). 



__**Problem**__

“As a local, sometimes I do not know what to do when I’m hanging out with my friends or spending time with my significant other.”
Sometimes local citizens has lived in their countries for a long time that they do not know where to head to for social related gatherings.

“As a tourist, I wish to experience the local culture over here but am not sure on how to do it.”
Tourists might have some form of uncertainty in trying certain things out. Especially in Singapore, price is a key consideration due to the high cost here.

“As a homegrown business owner, I need to find ways to attract customers to my shop so that I can sustain my startup.”
Local business owners might not know how to kick start their business to get people to be aware of their shops.

__**Solution**__

A service which assists the user in deciding his/her plans for the day, when hanging out with friends or dating with their significant other. This is to stretch the current capabilities of the Super App (Grab).

By using the service within the Super App, it ensures and not restricted to:
Allows smaller business (which are usually locally initiated) to be financially inclusive, improving their profit margins especially for new business owners
For the users (both locals and tourists), provides a recommended “itinerary” which removes the hassle of planning

By implementing the solution, the effects of benefitting Grab are:
Leverages on current dataset and technical infrastructure available to push the company beyond what it currently has achieved
Encourages more entities to join the platform
Positive side effects of improving the other services of Grab

__**Target Audience**__

Local citizens: support local initiated business
Tourist: be aware and experience authentic foriegn culture
Business owners: improves the finances of the business

Extensions:
Localised experience for each country in SEA
